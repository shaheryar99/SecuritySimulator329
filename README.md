ABOUT:
Welcome to the simulation. In which you have been hired to work for a company as a member on the security team. Your job is to protect the company's data. Throughout the simulation, random events or questions will appear and you will attempt to choose the best option. Incorrect answers will increase the threat on your threat bar similar to a health bar. This is found on the bottom of your screen once you start. The goal is to keep the threat level low. If you make unsafe choices and the threat gets high enough the game ends. Not every question might be completely wrong, however there will be a best solution, this means even though the answer may be correct your threat level could rise. After each question or event you will receive feedback about the question. It will explain the pros and cons of each choice. It is now up to you to keep the company safe!


TO START: Execute SecuritySimulator.exe to launch the game.
